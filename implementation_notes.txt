IMPLEMENTATION NOTES - Web-Scraping & File Retrieval Agent
=========================================================

Date Started: Implementation begins
Based on: web_agent_prd.md

ASSUMPTIONS MADE:
================
1. Starting with Phase 1 (MVP) - rule-based scraper with SQLite
2. Using Python 3.11+ as specified in PRD
3. Local file storage initially (not S3)
4. Simple rule-based filtering before implementing LLM reasoning
5. SQLite database will be stored in data/ directory
6. Logs will be written to data/logs/ directory
7. Configuration will support multiple sites as shown in PRD example
8. Using Playwright in headless mode for better performance
9. Implementing basic retry logic (3 attempts as per PRD)
10. Following robots.txt compliance as specified

QUESTIONS TO RESOLVE:
====================
1. Should we implement basic authentication handling in Phase 1?
2. What specific file size limits should we impose for downloads?
3. Should we implement rate limiting per site in the initial version?
4. How should we handle sites that require JavaScript execution vs static HTML?
5. What log level should be default (INFO, DEBUG)?
6. Should the agent support resuming interrupted downloads?
7. How should we handle different character encodings in scraped content?

TECHNICAL DECISIONS:
===================
1. Using SQLite with SQLAlchemy ORM for easier database operations
2. Implementing async/await pattern for better concurrency
3. Using Pydantic for configuration validation and data models
4. Structuring as a proper Python package with __init__.py files
5. Using pathlib for cross-platform path handling
6. Implementing structured logging with JSON format for better parsing
7. Using requests-html initially, may upgrade to Playwright for JS-heavy sites

IMPLEMENTATION ORDER:
====================
1. Project structure and basic files
2. Configuration system and validation
3. Database models and memory module
4. Basic perception module (web scraping)
5. Rule-based reasoning module
6. File download action module
7. Main orchestrator loop
8. Docker containerization
9. Basic tests

DEVIATIONS FROM PRD:
===================
- None yet, following PRD closely for Phase 1 implementation

NEXT STEPS:
==========
- Create directory structure ✓
- Set up requirements.txt ✓
- Implement configuration system ✓
- Build core modules incrementally (IN PROGRESS)

PROGRESS UPDATE:
===============
- Created complete project structure
- Implemented comprehensive data models with Pydantic and SQLAlchemy
- Built memory management system with database operations
- Created configuration management with environment variable substitution
- Added comprehensive error handling and logging throughout

CURRENT STATUS:
==============
✅ PHASE 1 MVP IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE!

Core modules implemented:
- models.py ✓ (Complete data models with Pydantic/SQLAlchemy)
- memory.py ✓ (Database operations and persistent state)
- config.py ✓ (Configuration management with env vars)
- perception.py ✓ (Web scraping with Playwright/BeautifulSoup)
- reasoning.py ✓ (Rule-based filtering and prioritization)
- action.py ✓ (File downloads with retry logic)
- orchestrator.py ✓ (Main agent loop and coordination)

Supporting files:
- requirements.txt ✓ (All dependencies)
- Dockerfile ✓ (Container deployment)
- config/settings.yaml ✓ (Global configuration)
- config/sites.yaml ✓ (Site-specific configuration)
- tests/ ✓ (Basic test suite)
- README.md ✓ (Comprehensive documentation)
- infra/airflow_dag.py ✓ (Phase 2 orchestration example)

IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE: Ready for testing and deployment!
